All programs in the Homework folder were coded and tested in Python 3.9.5.Conda environment was utilized and Spyder was used as IDE.All programs work in terminal, but for the convenience of the grader, a graphic IDE is recommended because no csv file output is given. All the predictions are returned in arrays.All programs require the datasets in their folder. Please consider using the folders as is.The dependencies are:* Numpy* Pandas* sklearn (Scikit-learn)* matplotlib* imblearnAll programs are ready to execute. No parameter is needed. Every training, test, calculation and measurements are done by default. If you desire to get the predicted labels for any of the programs above for q2 and q3, after executing the program by “python main.py”, you should command "train_y_pred" or “test_y_pred” to terminal. It will return a numpy array. The solution for q1 uses a training loop.
The class-based accuracy and confusion matrix are already printed after the execution of the program.
